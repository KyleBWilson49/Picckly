* Moodly

Submission for the 2016 Developer Week Hackathon - February 13-14, 2016

Winner of Microsoft's 'Super Challenge with Cortana Analytics'

Moodly includes 4 main features:

1) A facial recognition based authentication system using Microsoft's Face and Emotion APIs. Users first create an account by providing a username and taking a picture with their webcam. Future visits to the website will then require taking a picture to retrieve the correct user followed by responding to a prompt for an emotion in order to log in.

2) Real-time emotion data using Google Charts API. When on the website, the user has pictures taken every few seconds and emotion data is updated immediately on the page. Data gathered includes a pie chart for emotion percentage totals, a bar graph representing the current emotion state, and a line graph showing each emotion since account creation.

3) Real-time text-to-mood interpretation using Microsoft's Text Analytics API. Users can type in words, sentences, or even paragraphs and a slider will display the general mood of the text.

4) Tweet positivity/negativity data using Microsoft's Text Analytics API along with the Twitter API and the Google Charts API. The user inputs a Twitter handle and that handle's previous 20 Tweets are displayed along with a line graph showing their positivity in relation to each other. Each Tweet is also color coded on a positive/negative scale (green/red).
